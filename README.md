# bootcamp
A Minimal social networking application using Flask

## Setup

1. **Clone this Repo**

    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/SriNandan33/bootcamp.git 
    ```

2. **Install Python version 3.6 or greater**

	  https://www.python.org/downloads/
		
3. **Create virtual environment and activate  it**

	```
    python3 -m venv venv
	source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. **Install requirements**

	```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
	
5. **Create .flaskenv file and add required environment variables**
	```
	FLASK_APP=run.py
	FLASK_DEBUG=true
	MAIL_SERVER=smtp.googlemail.com
	MAIL_PORT=587
	MAIL_USE_TLS=1
	MAIL_USERNAME=<your-email-address>
